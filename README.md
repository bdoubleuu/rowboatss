<h1 align="center">Row / Rowboat — Unreal Engine Modding & Exploiting</h1>

<p align="center">
  i love poking at games, reversing how they tick, and bending them until they sing.  
  some mods shipped. some experiments crashed my PC and laughed. either way — i learned.

<p align="center">
  • modding framework for Rowboat (runtime patch loader) — experimental<br>
  • mapping physics interactions to custom inputs (boat controls & camera) — proof of concept<br>
  • tool to inspect UObject hierarchies at runtime (read-only inspector) — WIP

<h3 align="center">principles</h3>

<p align="center">
  • learn first — experiments must be reversible and safe when possible.<br>
  • respect servers & other players — I test on private builds or with explicit permission.<br>
  • document everything — so I (and others) can reproduce and learn.
